# Github-Navigation (djf72904)
This repository's sole purpose is to help organize my other Github repos since the platform does not allow grouping of them. :(  
Only repos by me ([djf72904](https://github.com/djf72904)) or ones that I have worked on will be shown here.  
*Important note: Due to academic integrity concerns, many repos listed here (especially those relating to university coursework) are private.*
